		<p class='article-text body'>Analog is a contentious and richly connotative term. To the consumer at large, it signifies the outmoded tech of a bygone era—but to the musician, it is the hallmark of quality.</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>A musical instrument is analog if its output is continuously variable. This stands in contrast to a digital instrument which synthesizes sound from binary data: the resulting output is not continuous but discrete.</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>All acoustic instruments are analog, but not all analog instruments are acoustic. Electric and electronic instruments can also be analog. Though, rather than vibrating air particles directly to produce sound, they oscillate an electrical quantity, namely voltage. Such is the sound-generating mechanism of the analog synthesizer.</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>In the same way that phonograph records and cassette tapes are said to have unique sonic qualities, subtle idiosyncrasies in the circuitry of these synths makes them highly prized among musicians. Though, for a time, they were spurned and abandoned along with other analog devices as the digital revolution ushered in a new technological age. Today, musicians are beginning to rediscover their inimitable organic sound.</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>Mark I dispenses with the idea that analog synths are any sort of antique—but rather, an alternative mode of musical expression unbound by time. Mark I pushes the envelope with a radical design never before seen on a musical instrument. It delivers classic analog sound with innovative digital controls that engage and amplify creative expression: controls like an enhanced priority knob, ModPad, and a real-time front panel. All this expressive capability is delivered in a beautifully crafted form factor that appears elegant onstage and in the studio.</p>
