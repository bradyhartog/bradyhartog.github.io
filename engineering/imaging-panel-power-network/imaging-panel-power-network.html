		<p class='article-text body'>An optimized circuit system for supplying power to fluoroscopic imaging panels.</p>
		<p class='article-text heading'>Problem</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>The existing power distribution network (“PDN”) design exceeds the available area on some panels’ printed circuit boards.</p>
		<p class='article-text heading'>Objective</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>Condense the area of the PDN while optimizing for high efficiency, fast transient response, and low noise.</p>
		<p class='article-text heading'>Process</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>The existing PDN occupies a large area owing to the use of many single-channel switching regulators. By designing with dual-channel switching regulators, multiple power lines can be consolidated into smaller circuits which provide comparable performance to the single-channel alternatives.</p>
		<p class='article-text heading'>Outcome</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>The condensed PDN design meets specifications for efficiency, transient response, and noise while reducing board area by 46% as compared to the previous design.</p>
