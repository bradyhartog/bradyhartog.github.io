		<p class='article-text body'>Magnetic flux leakage (“MFL”) is an imaging technology used for detecting corrosion in pipelines. This project used Python scripting to leverage existing MFL sensor data for visualizing pit-like defects.</p>
		<p class='article-text heading'>Problem</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>Typically, MFL is intended for visualizing areas of corrosion in pipelines; however, it is advantageous to use MFL data for visualizing other types of defects additionally. Because MFL relies on triaxial Hall effect sensors (which measure in each of the axial, radial, and circumferential dimensions), theoretically this is possible; however, a software tool was not presently available to the team for doing so.</p>
		<p class='article-text heading'>Objective</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>Visually reconstruct pit-like defects using MFL imaging data.</p>
		<p class='article-text heading'>Process</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>Visualizations were made with Python using plotting libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The problem was explored in a series of experiments aimed at investigating various facets of the data.</p>

		<p class='article-text caption'>A problem: The limited charging rate the Hall effect sensors distorts the impression of the defect. This contour taken from the magnitude plot above shows smooth edges, whereas the actual defect has sharp edges. This showed that in order to accurately reconstruct a pit-like defect, a sharpening algorithm is needed.</p>
