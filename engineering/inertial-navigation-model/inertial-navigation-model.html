		<p class='article-text body'>A probabilistic model based on Bayes’ theorem for accurately determining the angular orientation of pipeline inspection tools.</p>
		<p class='article-text heading'>Problem</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>Due to the motion of mechanical couplings between component bodies of pipeline inspection tools, imaging data becomes misaligned with respect to the angular orientations of the bodies. The existing inertial navigation system (“INS”) in pipeline inspection tools is unable to accurately determine angular orientation on a body-to-body basis.</p>
		<p class='article-text heading'>Objective</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>Design a model for more accurately determining the angular orientation of tool bodies.</p>
		<p class='article-text heading'>Outcome</p>
		<p class='article-text body'>The new model accurately determines the angular orientation of tool bodies to within 1° and better. This meets the design specification of 2° and better and improves from 7° and better with the existing system.</p>

		<p class='article-text caption'>Bivariate histogram of INS element response with respect to measured orientation. Note the greater spread in the marginal distribution of INS response around 0° and 180°, where the response approaches zero and therefore makes the orientation difficult to measure.</p>
